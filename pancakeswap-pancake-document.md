 Then after breakfast, PancakeSwap is aiming to be the \\#1 liquidity provider on Binance Smart Chain and the home of new, innovative gamified farming mechanics, many of which we suspect will make it to other chains and beyond.

 To be honest, it’s a no brainer. In very simple terms, why would we want to drive a slower car that costs more to run? While BSC might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at current, we believe in Binance’s ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future. Sure, launching on Ethereum would be the easiest thing to do and probably receive faster initial uptake, but we like a challenge and are betting on BSC’s future. It's a no brainer!

 What does that mean exactly? We’re going to be trying new things, with a focus on gamification. For starters, we are a bakery, ahem. We’re here to have FUN and love our frens on BSC so much, we replicated their work from the ground up, but hats off to the OGs. PancakeSwap took Binance by storm and we aim to do the same for the Polkadot ecosystem.  
 What does that mean exactly? We’re going to be trying new things, with a focus on gamification with elements right out the minds of blockchain developers, marketing experts, economists, front-end web\(3\) developers, and some frens with deep pockets who know what we are capable of achieving and are eager to show their support.
