# Swap

First, navigate to [https://swap.easybake.finance/\#/swap](https://swap.easybake.finance/#/swap)

Select the currencies you are swapping. In our case, we will be swapping our ETH for OVEN.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

Input the amount of the `From` currency you wish to swap for the `To` currency you have selected, then click on `Swap Anyway` \(`Swap Anyway`will say `Swap` if the `Price Impact` isn't too high\).

![The little box at the bottom displays the transaction details.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

We've been prompted with a `Confirm Swap` modal that displays:  
1. The `From` currency \(ETH\) amount.  
2. How much`To` currency \(OVEN\) we will be receiving in exchange for the `From` currency.  
3. The details of the transaction \(Price, Minimum received, Price impact & Liquidity Provider Fee\)  
4. A `Swap Anyway` \(or `Swap`\) button that allows us to proceed with our transaction.  
  
You may have noticed that the amount of OVEN has changed in the `Confirm Swap` modal. This is because users like yourself are also swapping, in real time, which causes the value of each currency in the pair \(in this case, ETH-OVEN\) to change.   
  
We're going to click on the`Swap Anyway` button because we're okay with the outcome of this transaction. So lets go ahead of click on it.

Now the `Waiting for confirmation` modal has appeared & a `Metamask Notification` has been prompted on the top right of our screen. We are given some options here.   
  
Notice at the top of the `Metamask Notification` there is our account sending 1 ETH to `0x01Cc...68...`.   
`0x01Cc...68...` is the contract address we're sending our ETH to so it can activate the function `SWAP EXACT ETH FOR TOKENS` which will send us the equivalent `To` tokens \(OVEN\).   
  
If the Ethereum Blockchain is being used more than usual, we may want to increase our `Gas Limit` so our transaction doesn't fail \(consequently, we will be paying fees for a failed transaction\). However, today there is not a lot of abnormal activity & the `Gas Price` is relatively low \(you can check here: [https://www.ethgasstation.info/](https://www.ethgasstation.info/)\).   
  
There is a `Reject` and `Confirm` button at the bottom left of the `Metamask Notification.` If we are happy with the transaction we will press `Confirm.` This will submit the transaction to be mined & if successful, we will receive the beloved OVEN.

Our transaction was successful!

Now you should see your updated balances for the `From` currency & the `To` currency. Congratulations, you now own OVEN!
