# How to use the Bakery

## Navigating to the Bakery UI

First, we need to locate the Bakery tab, located on the far left of your screen.   
  
Once we the page has loaded, we will be greeted by the current DOUGH Liquidity Pools available, in the Bakery row format.

To change the rows into cards, click on the second icon \(the grid\) to the far left of the `Baking Only` toggle button. Note: This will provide less details than the row format \(i.e. Liquidity\).

If you cannot see the options displayed above, make sure you connect to one of the networks available \(in our case, Rinkeby\)

## **Using the Bakery**

Now that we are in the Bakery, lets deposit some of the OVEN/ETH DOUGH tokens we just received, from providing liquidity, to start earning OVEN! 

To begin, lets click on `Approve Contract` on the `OVEN-ETH` card. This will give access to the contract to move the DOUGH tokens in our wallet into the oven so we can start earning OVEN. Don't worry, there is no way the contract can steal your DOUGH!

Now that the contract has access, we are able to `Bake LP`. Lets click on that & begin to bake our DOUGH!

We want to provide as much DOUGH as possible as early as possible because the more people there are providing DOUGH, the less we will be receiving. This is because the OVEN provided to each oven is distributed accordingly to each person providing DOUGH & to how much they are providing. So, the earlier you are, & the more you provide, the more OVEN you will be earning!  
  
Having said that, lets provide the max DOUGH we can buy clicking on the `Max` button. This will input all the DOUGH we have for the selected oven pair \(in our case, OVEN/ETH\).  
  
After we have inputted the max amount, lets click on the `Confirm` button to submit the transaction.

As you can see, another `Metamask Notification` has appeared. This time we are using the `Deposit` function in the `Masterchef` contract.   
  
We like the details provided so it is time to `Confirm` and start earning!

Wow!   
  
Look how much I have earned in that short period of time!  
  
To receive the `EARNED OVEN` click on the `Collect` button & accept the transaction.

If you want to add more or remove the DOUGH that is baking inside of the oven, click on the corresponding `+` or `-` button, and click on the `Confirm` button to submit the transaction.   


For example, here is the prompt from the `-` button. We are able to take our DOUGH out of the oven. Howver, we want to keep on earning OVEN, so we're not going to take it out.
