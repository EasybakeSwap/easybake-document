# Pools

\*\*\*\*[**EasyBakeSwap Pools** ](https://app.EasyBakeSwap.finance/#/pool) allow you to provide liquidity by adding your tokens to liquidity pools or “LPs”.

When you add your token to a liquidity pool \(LP\), you will receive DOUGH tokens \(EasyBakeSwap’s version of liquidity provider tokens\). 

For example, if you deposit $OVEN and $ETH into a liquidity pool, you will receive OVEN-ETH DOUGH tokens. 

The number of DOUGH tokens you receive represents your portion of the OVEN-ETH liquidity pool. You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.  
[“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)

It’s not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades EasyBakeSwap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the liquidity pool of the swap pair they traded on. 

For example:

* There are 10 DOUGH tokens representing 10 OVEN and 10 ETH tokens.
* 1 DOUGH token = 1 OVEN + 1 ETH
* Someone trades 10 OVEN for 10 ETH.
* Someone else trades 10 ETH for 10 OVEN.
* The OVEN/ETH liquidity pool now has 10.017 OVEN and 10.017 ETH.
* Each DOUGH token is now worth 1.00017 OVEN + 1.00017 ETH.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your DOUGH tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield in our proprietary [OVEN farms \(here\)](https://easybake.finance/farms), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.
