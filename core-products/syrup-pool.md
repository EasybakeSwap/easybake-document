# SUGAR Pool

**Imagine:**

1. You STAKE your OVEN to get some SUGAR üòã
2. Now you are earning a portion of 25% of each block reward
3. Now you stake that SUGAR and start earning tokens from brand new Polkadot projects!

This is galaxy mega brain OVEN compounding.

Your OVEN is now pulling in **multiple** income streams.

Sounds‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsweet‚Äù, right? üòè

**SUGAR Pool: where sweet, new tokens meet the EasyBake community!**

Sugar Pool allows Polkadot projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to SUGAR token holders.

Sugar Pool will be split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the EasyBakeSwap team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note: any project will be able to distribute tokens via Sugar Pool, but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since EasyBakeSwap will launch similar to PancakeSwap, who has had the [fairest launch ever](https://medium.com/@pancakeswap/the-fairest-launch-ever-5b246644ba2a), SUGAR Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the largest \(and most active\) DOT community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the EasyBakeSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).

**Extending the utility of SUGAR tokens**

Governance, collecting fees, collecting OVEN block rewards and the \(upcoming\) Golden Sugar lottery are some of the SUGAR token‚Äôs core utility functions‚Ä¶ for now.

With SUGAR Pool, a new function has been offered for SUGAR holders in EasyBakeSwap: adding the toppings to $SUGAR and the $OVEN
