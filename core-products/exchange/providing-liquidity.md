# Providing Liquidity

Now that we've swapped some ETH for OVEN, we can now provide liquidity to the OVEN/ETH pair to begin earning transaction fees from users that are swapping tokens within that pool.   
  
But first lets navigate to the `Liquidity` page. We get here by clicking on the `Swap` tab on the left, then clicking on the `Liquidity` tab at the top of the swap interface.

Now we're on [https://swap.easybake.finance/\#/pool](https://swap.easybake.finance/#/pool). This is where we are able to view our unbaked DOUGH \(EasyBake's unique liquidity pool tokens\).   
  
We're currently providing DOUGH in the DAI/ETH pair. Today, we're going to provide liquidity to the OVEN/ETH pair because we just swapped some ETH for OVEN in the previous page, `Swapping Tokens`

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2821%29.png)

Lets begin by clicking on the `Add Liquidity` button. This will take us to [https://swap.easybake.finance/\#/find](https://swap.easybake.finance/#/find). Here, we are able to import a DOUGH pool, in this case we're going to select EasyBake's native token, OVEN.

Since we have no DOUGH tokens for the OVEN/ETH pair, we're going to need to add liquidity via the `Add Liquidity` button. So, lets click on it!

Now, input your desired amounts to provide. The interface will automatically match how much you've inputted in the corresponding currency. This is done so you don't have to do all the nitty gritty inputs under the hood :\)   
  
We've inputted 1 ETH to begin with & the interface automatically calculates how much OVEN we need to provide to match the initial input, which is `338.342` OVEN.   
  
Now all we need to do is click on the `Approve OVEN` button so that we're giving the contract access to our OVEN to move it into a DOUGH token pair, after we click on `Supply`

When you click on `Supply`, the `You will receive` modal is prompted & you will be able to see the details of the transaction. If you like what you see, click on `Confirm Supply`

Like when we were on the `Swap` page, we are greeted with a `Metamask Notification` that is displaying the contract function we're using \(`Add Liquidity ETH`\), the amount of ETH we're using in that function, the `Gas Limit` to execute the transaction & the `Reject` & `Confirm` buttons.   
  
We're happy with the details shown, so we're going click on `Confirm` and submit the transaction.

At the top of the screen, you will see a notification of the successful transaction.

And at the bottom, you will be able to see the updated `LP TOKENS IN YOUR WALLET`

Congratulations, you just provided DOUGH to the OVEN/ETH pair!   
  
Now, we are able to `Bake` our DOUGH in the `Bakery` and earn extra OVEN on top of the fees we're earning from providing liquidity. We'll discuss this on the next page \(Bakery\). See you there, Chef!
